For Minecraft 1.19 choose between optifine or iris and sodium
If you want My config for inventory profiles next(the one that adds the green overlay on items you are hovering over) copy config folder as well

**Note it is recomended to change either the maps keybind or litmatica's keybind(both are configured to m) if you want to change litematicas you have to change the minimaps keybind to access the litematica config menu.

Usefull keybinds:
minimap : m
Litematica Menu : m
InventoryProfileNext config : R+C
WTHIT config : numpad 0
MiniHUD config : H+C
Light Overlay : F7
